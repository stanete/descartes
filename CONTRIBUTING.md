# Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute to this project. Just have in mind the following:

1. Follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format for the title. It is important you write a good title from the beginning so other people know what the PR is about. Even if it is a Draft PR. Remember that some people have notifications enabled for this repository.
2. Add a good description when opening a PR. Even if it is a draft PR. Take in mind that multiple teams contribute to this project and no team has context of other teams. The review of the PR is going to be easier and faster if you provide as much context as possible.
3. Try to make the PR a manageable size. More than 300 changes is a red flag. More than 10 files is a red flag. There are exceptions like renaming a package or moving files around.
4. This is obvious but... add the necessary tests.
