# descartes

Hosting a personal blog instead of joining a platform like Medium removes the network effects. Descartes aims to create an underneath network of content delivery and recommendation based on the content itself. Descartes aims to connect personal blogs and help readers find quality related content. Descartes is privacy first. No data about the readers that read the content is needed.
